sqlbuilder
==========

This is intended to be a small library which builds SQL statements. 
The inspiration came from [here](http://code.google.com/p/squiggle-sql/), but I wanted to have my own library.

I would like to emphasise that this is strongly under development and although it is done with purist TDD, I never executed a single query on a real database. 

But.

I would like to some day. Till that day, I'll work. Happy coding!
